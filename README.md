# Mondrian-project
A simple Mondrian-style layout built using HTML and CSS Grid. This project replicates the abstract art of Piet Mondrian to practice modern CSS layout techniques.

The Mondrian Project is a front-end web development exercise that involves recreating a piece of artwork inspired by the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian, known for his distinctive abstract compositions of geometric shapes, bold lines, and primary colors (red, blue, yellow, black, and white).

In this project, CSS Grid (and sometimes Flexbox) is used to layout the blocks in a precise, grid-like format. The project is an excellent way to learn and practice modern layout techniques, responsiveness, and design accuracy.

ðŸ”§ **Key Concepts Practiced:**
CSS Grid (mainly) or Flexbox for layout
grid-template-areas, grid-column, grid-row for positioning
Box sizing, borders, and spacing
Use of background colors and width/height controls
Pixel-perfect design replication
Mobile responsiveness (optional)
